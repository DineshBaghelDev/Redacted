# Progress

## 2026-09-06

- Restyled the signed-in and signed-out home screen as a pixel-noir title menu using the supplied city-office background.
- Added the signed-in home screen with logo placeholder and room action buttons.
- Applied Pixelify Sans as the global site font.
- Kept room actions as UI-only buttons until room flows exist.
- Added the first Convex room flow: signed-in players can create a room, join by code, and see the joined room indicator.
- Reworked the signed-in start flow: detective name, menu, create-room modal, join-room form, previous-games cards, loading screen, fresh-start confirmation, and empty case brief.
- Improved the room lobby with saved detective profile name, copy-room-code, player ready states, start gating, friendlier join errors, and a red leave-room action.
- Converted the join-room form from an inline panel into a modal overlay with a close button, matching the room modal pattern.
- Modularized the room hub into a `room-hub/` folder: a `useRoomSession` hook for room flow logic, a `constants` file for shared styles, and one screen component per file under `screens/`.
- Join-room dialog now takes the room code as six single-character OTP-style boxes (auto-advance, backspace navigation, paste support) and shows join errors inside the dialog instead of behind it.
- Main-menu options are now borderless plain text that reveal the pixel-noir border/background on hover or keyboard focus.
- Fixed the detective-name dialog flashing on reload: the room hub now waits for the client to read the saved name from localStorage before rendering anything, eliminating the SSR/client mismatch.
- Hardened room lifecycle actions with waiting-state and membership checks, persisted leave cleanup, visible lobby errors, and selected-case handoff into the case brief.

## 2026-09-24

- Redesigned the case-generation plan in `docs/GENERATION.md` (crime core, cast, timeline, code-derived evidence, lies, validation, repair); no code yet.
- Case generation setup: installed Convex workflow component, NIM-compatible AI SDK provider, Zod, Vitest and convex-test; added a seeded random helper with tests.
- Added `generationJobs` / `generationDrafts` tables, a stage list (`convex/generation/stages.ts`) and a dev-only generation tester at `/dev/generation` (allowlisted by `DEV_TOOL_USER_IDS`) that runs one stage at a time and shows its output and problems.
- Built the permanent V1 city: 20 places, 25 streets, 5 building templates (199 rooms), 8 street cameras and 52 room cameras, route finding, city checks, and tests (including a snapshot guarding city ids). The tester's first stage now shows the city.
- Tester: stage 0 now shows a clickable city map (streets, minutes, camera streets) and each building's floors, rooms, cameras, doors and item slots. Added fixed map positions to places.
